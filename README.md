This project is a todo app using Next.js 13 and React. The app lets users sign in and create workspaces. A workspace will be a todo list from which users can add and delete a todo item. Furthermore, the user can change a todo's priority, status and tag. This project utilized a lot of features and concepts I previously learned when building [Promptopia](https://github.com/abbbringu/promptopia) and my [Personal website](https://github.com/abbbringu/Personal-website).
The landing page is responsive. But the todo pages aren't.

## Devlopment

This project was for my level of experience neither too easy nor too difficult. There are still some problems and bugs regarding API calls and protected API and pages. Also had som problems with Typscript which lead to deployment errors. 

### Learned

- How to use and utilize API routes.
- How to use and utilize Nextjs's dynamic routes.
- Passing props to child components.
- Implementing Authentication
- Connecting to MongoDB

### Future improvements:

- [ ] Better implementation with next-auth for page and API protection
- [ ] Manage data better instead of making multiple API calls
- [ ] Resolve type errors for deployment
