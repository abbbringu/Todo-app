This project is a todo app using Next.js 13 and React. The app lets users sign in and create workspaces. A workspace will be a todo list which users can add and delete a todo item. Further more, the user can change a todo's priority, status and tag. This project utilized a lot of features anc concept I previously learned when building [Promptopia](https://github.com/abbbringu/promptopia) and my [Personal website](https://github.com/abbbringu/Personal-website).
The landing page is responsive. But the todo pages aren't.

## Devlopment

This project was for my level of experice niether too easy nor too difficult. There are still some problems and bugs regarding api calls and protected api and pages.

### Learned

- How to use and utilize api routes.
- How to use and utilize nextjs's dynamic routes.
- Passing props to child components.
- Implementing Authentication
- Connecting to MongoDB

### Future improvemnts:

- Better implementation with next-auth for page and api protection
- Manage data better instead of making multiple api calls

This is the live [`demo`]() which was deployed with [`vercel`](https://vercel.com/).
